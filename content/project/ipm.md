## Skagit River steelhead

I developed a Bayesian IPM for a population of steelhead from the Skagit River to help biologists from the [Skagit River System Cooperative](http://skagitcoop.org/) and the [Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife](http://wdfw.wa.gov/) examine the effects of hatchery releases and instream flows on steelhead production. You can find a detailed description of the methods [here](https://mdscheuerell.github.io/ASSESSOR/).

## Snake River Chinook

[Eric Buhle](mailto:eric.buhle@noaa.gov), [Jim Thorson](https://sites.google.com/site/thorsonresearch/), and I have developed an [R package](https://github.com/ebuhle/salmonIPM) to fit a Bayesian IPM to multiple populations of Pacific salmon. Our model also includes broodstock removals for hatchery operations and the effects of hatchery-origin fish spawning in the wild. We are using the model to conduct population viability assessments and evaluate possible effects of various harvest control rules.
