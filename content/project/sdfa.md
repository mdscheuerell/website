I have been working with [Jim Thorson](https://sites.google.com/site/thorsonresearch/) and several others on a variety of applications of joint dynamic species density models (JDSDM) to marine and terrestrial fauna. You can learn more about the models, applications, and __R__ packages at the [FishStats](https://james-thorson.github.io/) website.
