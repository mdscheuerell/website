[Eric Ward](https://faculty.washington.edu/warde/), [Steve Katz](http://cahnrs.wsu.edu/soe/people/facultynstaff/stephenkatz/), and I have developed an [R package](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/tvvarss) to fit a Bayesian version of the model developed by [Ives & Dakos (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1890/ES11-00347.1). We expanded on their model to include multiple different forms of observation models. We are using it to examine changing species interactions and community stability in kelp forest ecosystems.
