[Eli Holmes](https://faculty.washington.edu/eeholmes/), [Eric Ward](https://faculty.washington.edu/warde/), and I have developed an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MARSS/index.html) with a detailed [userâ€™s guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MARSS/vignettes/UserGuide.pdf) for analyzing a variety of multivariate time series problems under a maximum likelihood framework. Examples include movement tracking, dynamic linear models (DLM), dynamic factor analysis (DFA), and estimating community interactions & stability.
